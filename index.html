  <h1> Heat Vulnerable districts in Brooklyn need more tree-shades </h1>
  <p id=byline> <i> By Saugat Bolakhe </i></p>

  <p> <b> Tree shades can be a good way to battle against rising heating in cities. NYC department of parks and recreation is investing more on street tree caring events. But data indicates that these efforts should be directed more towards heat vulnerable districts. </b>

  <p> On Oct. 15, NYC parks and Nature Conservancy hosted the first ever ‘City of Forests Day’ organizing 53 parallel street tree-caring events across the city boroughs. The message was loud and clear: They want more locals to become tree stewards and help save the street trees.
 </p>

  <p> A recent report from New York City health and environment shows that there are four community district in Brooklyn that are most vulnerable to the extreme effect of summer heat. Most residents in these community districts are likely to be injured or harmed during periods of hot weather. So, efforts of more plantation and tree caring should be focused more on these parts of the borough.

  “We are aware that there are some districts that need more tree shades than others. we want to focus on carrying out street tree caring events on heat vulnerable districts, where tree canopy coverage can be increased, and summer temperature can be brought down significantly,” said Emily Nobel Maxwell, New York Cities Program Director at the nature conservancy, a non-profit organization advocating for nature and environment in New York.
